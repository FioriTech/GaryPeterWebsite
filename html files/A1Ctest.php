                    <p>This event has been one of our most enjoyable and valuable service project. Together we served remarkably, more than 110 people from 9 AM – 3 PM with their A1C reading and educated them about how best they can keep control the blood sugar level in future. The event was very well received by all, as the actual event was scheduled till 1 PM, due to overwhelming response the entire team patiently kept serving the people till 3 PM.
                        <br />
